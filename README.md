# FOXX-OS
A new kind of OS, similar to EmuOS. Runs in a browser. Made for no apparrent reason, just because I'm getting extremely bored, and I know this language well, so I built this.

## Usage
Made for playing audio, and viewing Videos, and Pictures. It also has some embedded web apps, including one of my other repos NBSEditor. It also has Cloud Convert, YouTube, and more to come.

## Installation
Requires none. Just open a browser and go to the website.

## Requirements
Requires a wifi connection, which you probably already have if your viewing this.
